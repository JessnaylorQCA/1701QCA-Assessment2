### Related project 1 ###
Security Box

![Image](rp1.png)

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it sets off an alarm. This is a feature that is being utilised in my project.  The alarm in this project is used to alert the owner when someone has opened the box, whereas the alarm in my project is being used to alert the user when it is time to have another drink. 

### Related project 2 ###
Countdown Timer

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it involves a timer that countdown. In my project, the timer will reactivate every 5 minutes, this will then trigger an output that tells the user it is time to drink once again.

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it once again is an alarm. This is a factor that is going to be used in this project. However, this alarm is activated when it is trigger, acting as a security system, whereas my project has an alarm that goes off after a certain time rather than when it is triggered.

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it uses a motor to control the temperature gauge. I will be using a motor in my project to turn the platform that the water bottle sits on. 

### Related project 6 ###
Micro: bit Egg Timer

### *Brief resource name/description* ###
https://makecode.microbit.org/device/servo

As I have not tested the motor yet, I am unsure as to whether I will need to use a mini servo instead in my project to assist with the turning of the water bottles platform. This site explains how to equip the servo with “crocodile clips” that have been created from male strips.

The following source shows the code required for an alarm to play. This can be beneficial when creating the code for this project as it assists in creating alarm reminding the user to drink water. 

https://www.kitronik.co.uk/blog/using-bbc-microbit-control-servo/

This source explains how to use the BBC Micro: bit to control the servo. This is important as it will assist me in getting the servo to work effectively and spin the platform at the correct speed.

In the past, I have had issues attempting to get the micro: bit to work. This website gives me a step by step guide as to how to get the micro: bit working again if the issues reoccur. This is extremely beneficial as it can endure that I do not waste time trying to fix the micro: bit on my own. 

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
In today's society, it is extremely common for people to forget to remain hydrated due to their busy schedule. This project will remind users when they need to drink water to ensure that they remain hydrated and healthy throughout the day.
